However, ongoing debates about the optimal cutoff significantly impact the clinical application of immunotherapy. The purpose of our study is to comprehensively evaluate TMB cutoffs for predicting immunotherapy outcomes across multiple studies, considering both cancer type and outcome endpoint, using statistically principled approaches. METHODS We analyzed data from PredictIO, curated through a PubMed search for studies involving immune checkpoint blockade treatment in the adjuvant setting, excluding those involving combinations with chemotherapy, targeted treatment, or radiation. The included studies, published between January 2015 and June 2022, required tumor sequencing data from whole exomes or targeted gene panels for TMB assessment. Outcome endpoints included clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). CBR was defined as the rate of complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting at least six months, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. OS and PFS were defined as the interval from treatment initiation to death and disease progression, respectively. TMB was uniformly derived from tumor sequencing data, representing the count of nonsynonymous mutations relative to the target sequencing size. TMB cutoffs were evaluated for outcome associations using study replicability analysis, alongside individual-study analysis and random-effects meta-analysis for comparison.

A widely advocated approach to improving replicability is through the rigorous control of predefined animal or experimental conditions, known as standardization. However, this approach limits the generalizability of the findings to only to the standardized conditions and is a potential cause rather than solution to what has been called a replicability crisis. Alternative strategies include estimating the heterogeneity of effects across laboratories, either through designs that vary testing conditions, or by direct statistical analysis of laboratory variation. We previously evaluated our statistical approach for estimating the interlaboratory replicability of a single laboratory discovery. Those results, however, were from a well-coordinated, multi-lab phenotyping study and did not extend to the more realistic setting in which laboratories are operating independently of each other. Here, we sought to test our statistical approach as a realistic prospective experiment, in mice, using 152 results from 5 independent published studies deposited in the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD). In independent replication experiments at 3 laboratories, we found that 53 of the results were replicable, so the other 99 were considered non-replicable. Of the 99 non-replicable results, 59 were statistically significant (at 0.05) in their original single-lab analysis, putting the probability that a single-lab statistical discovery was made even though it is non-replicable, at 59.6%.

With genotypes that were not included in the previous experiments? And can it be used to adjust the results of pharmacological treatment experiments? We replicated results from five studies in the Mouse Phenome Database (MPD), in three behavioral tests, across three laboratories, offering 212 comparisons including 60 involving a pharmacological treatment: 18 mg/kg/day fluoxetine.

However, ongoing debates about the optimal cutoff significantly impact the clinical application of immunotherapy. The purpose of our study is to comprehensively evaluate TMB cutoffs for predicting immunotherapy outcomes across multiple studies, considering both cancer type and outcome endpoint, using statistically principled approaches. METHODS We analyzed data from PredictIO, curated through a PubMed search for studies involving immune checkpoint blockade treatment in the adjuvant setting, excluding those involving combinations with chemotherapy, targeted treatment, or radiation. The included studies, published between January 2015 and June 2022, required tumor sequencing data from whole exomes or targeted gene panels for TMB assessment. Outcome endpoints included clinical benefit rate (CBR), progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). CBR was defined as the rate of complete response, partial response, or stable disease lasting at least six months, according to RECIST 1.1 criteria. OS and PFS were defined as the interval from treatment initiation to death and disease progression, respectively. TMB was uniformly derived from tumor sequencing data, representing the count of nonsynonymous mutations relative to the target sequencing size. TMB cutoffs were evaluated for outcome associations using study replicability analysis, alongside individual-study analysis and random-effects meta-analysis for comparison.
